        <h1>Growtopian Exchange Cancellation</h1>
        <p>I've decided to cancel Growtopian Exchange. After a 3-year break from Growtopia—a game I played on and off for 11 years—I started this project to help it. But during development, I saw the game’s future looks poor. I’ve built games, not websites, and using the wrong tools let the project spiral out of control.</p>
        <p>After a day of reflection, I realized it’s not worth my time, especially since I’ve basically quit Growtopia while working on it. Sorry if this disappoints anyone—thanks for the interest. I learned a ton in 2 months and I’m proud of that, but it’s just beyond my reach.</p>
        <p>Best of luck to you all, and to Growtopia.</p>
